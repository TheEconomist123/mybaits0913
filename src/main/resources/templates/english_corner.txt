South Korea’s democracy passed its biggest test in decades on Tuesday,
 as it quickly rebuffed a dubious declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol.
 Lawmakers immediately voted 190-0 to terminate the order,
 and Mr. Yoon acquiesced, with his cabinet approving a motion to end martial law at about 4:30 a.m. Wednesday.
